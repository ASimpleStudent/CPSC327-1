                  <strong><u>Questions</u><br>
                  <p>Q: For the load and store methods in data_store_file, how do we check to see if there is a crypto object defined? The header for data_store_file does not have a Crypto object listed as a variable, and the data_store has it listed as private, so the derived data_store_file can not access it from the base class. Am I missing something?</p></strong>
                  A:In the header for DataStore_File see the following constructor<br>

                  DataStore_File(std::string fileName, Crypto* crypto = 0);<br>
                  <p>
                  As part of object construction, you must also also call the base class constructor.  It takes a pointer to a crypto object and provides  encrypt decrypt functions.  Given that these functions are protected, they are accessible from DataStore_File for all its crypto needs. </p>
